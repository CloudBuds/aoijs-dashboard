the html css etc is **BAD** learn it im not putting my effort for you
to make sure you need these variables *put this in ur config.json once you have forked/cloned it*
```js
module.exports = {
monguri: 'urmongurihere',
token: 'bot token',
secret: 'client_secret',
id: 'bots id',
session_secret: 'sessionsecret',
ownerID: ['ownerid', 'other ownerID'], // keep this an array 
}
```
then make sure to install these 
(non-clone)
```json
passport-discord
express-session
passport
express
node-fetch
colors
```
then your done edit the `settings.ejs` to your variables
